# Javascript-Quiz

For this assignment I have created a timed quiz on some javascript knowledge.
the quiz has a timer that starts upon pressing the start quiz button and you are given
80 seconds to complete the quiz but you will lose 10 seconds of time for an incorrect answer.
your score is the time you have left remaining after the last question or you lose and can start again if you
run out of time. your high score is displayed after typing your name or initials.
